Configuration
=============

You have to configure the ``tableName``. That's the name of the table, as used in
TCA, where data should be written to.

In addition, you can define multiple ``columns`` as key-value pairs that will be added to the form
input. This allows you to define the storage ``pid`` or hide new records.
